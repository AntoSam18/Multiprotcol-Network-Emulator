# Multiprotcol-Network-Emulator
MPNe is a network emulator that simulates TCP, UDP, and more. It uses OSPF and BGP for dynamic routing in star topologies, analyzing packet loss and retransmissions. With traffic generation and congestion control, it visualizes detailed performance via a web dashboard, optimizing protocol efficiency.
